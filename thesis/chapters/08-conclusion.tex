\chapter{Conclusion}

In this work, we explore various DIP-based denoising methods and investigate their applicability to DAS data.
We introduce SGR-DIP, an extension of SG-DIP, and demonstrate its effectiveness on regular image data.
Furthermore, we show that DIP-based methods can achieve good denoising performance on DAS data; however not all approaches translate well to this context.
A key direction for future research is the development of an effective early stopping criterion for DAS data. This would not only enable the application of various DIP-based methods that showed promising results in our image denoising experiments but also reduce runtime, a major limitation of these approaches.
Additionally, exploring improved weight initialization strategies, e.g.\ through meta-learning~\cite{MetaDIP}, could further accelerate the optimization process.
