\chapter{Methods}\label{ch:methods}

While the self-supervised denoising methods discussed so far eliminate the need for clean data, most still require large datasets of noisy images or are limited to specific noise types.
A notable exception is the Deep Image Prior (DIP) introduced by Ulyanov~\etalc \cite{DIP}.
DIP is a zero-shot method, \ie it operates on a single noisy sample, and does not make any explicit assumptions about the noise distribution.

In this chapter, we present the DIP and various extensions.
First, we describe the fundamental principles of DIP, followed by common regularization techniques such as early stopping and total variation.
Finally, we explore other DIP-based approaches that build upon these foundations.
